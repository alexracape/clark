Some future enhancements and things that need fixing.

## Canvas
- Styling
- Allow users to toggle between PDF and Canvas mode.
  - Export as PDF would not be allowd for Canvas

## LLMs

## MCP

## TUI
- A little jumpiness in the UI when toggling some / menus
- /resource needs to accept file upload with file explorer, drag-and-drop, or something
- Need to refine the /structures commands
  - The model's responses are too verbose and need prompting work
  - Should look into ways to collect args like a conversational process in moveworks
- /canvas should let the user switch the active canvas


## Misc.
- Lightweight markdown editor potentially with tiptap
- Office hours and class notes stories
- Look into tldraw licensing
- Build site to publish the binary with documentation
- Onboarding should add folders like Structures if not in preexisting folder
- Security audit for API keys, prompt injection, or any other vulnerabilities
