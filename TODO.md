Some future enhancements and things that need fixing.

- Allow users to toggle between PDF and Canvas mode.
  - Export as PDF would not be allowd for Canvas
- Automatically delete intermediate blank pages if they are not last

## TUI
- /resource needs to accept file upload with file explorer, drag-and-drop, or something
- Need to refine the /structures commands
  - The model's responses are too verbose and need prompting work
  - Should look into ways to collect args like a conversational process in moveworks

## Misc.
