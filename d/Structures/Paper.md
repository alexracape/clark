## Purpose
This file corresponds to an academic paper that I read.

## Generation
It should contain headings for "Key Ideas" and "Questions." It will also link out to the pdf version of the paper. These files should be marked with the #paper tag. You should not fill in any of the ideas or questions unless you are able to read them from the annotations on the PDF.
