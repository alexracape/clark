## Purpose
These are raw documents that are not in markdown format. They could be images, PDFs, slides, etc.
## Generation
When processing a new resource, you should add it into the appropriate folder in the Resources directory. There are directories right now for "Images", "PDFs", and "Transcriptions".

When a resource is added, you should create a markdown transcription and put that in the "Transcriptions" folder. This transcript should be in markdown format while preserving headers and bullet points for the structure of the document. Images or diagrams should be tagged with a markdown link. Math should be formatted in LaTeX.

If relevant, add this resource to a `Class`, `Problem Set` or `Paper`.
